# Comparative Analysis of Australian Housing Markets (2011–2023)

This project examines the housing markets of New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia (SA) over a 12-year period using statistical techniques including hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Analyze housing price trends in NSW and SA.
- Investigate statistical relationships between price changes and economic indicators (population growth, dwelling approvals, cash rate, and state final demand).
- Determine which state presents better opportunities for investment based on risk and return profiles.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- NSW exhibited higher price growth but also greater volatility.
- SA offered more stable growth with housing supply tightly linked to price changes.
- Regression models showed state-specific drivers: population growth negatively influenced NSW prices, while dwelling approvals were key in SA.
