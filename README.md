# Comparative Analysis of Australian Housing Markets (2011–2023)

This project examines the housing markets of New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia (SA) over a 12-year period using statistical techniques including hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.
Full report details findings and overall key metrics, methodologies, and research limitations of the analysis (feel free to check it out!) 

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Analyze housing price trends in NSW and SA.
- Investigate statistical relationships between price changes and economic indicators (population growth, dwelling approvals, cash rate, and state final demand).
- Determine which state presents better opportunities for investment based on risk and return profiles.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- NSW exhibited higher price growth but also greater volatility.
- SA offered more stable growth with housing supply tightly linked to price changes.
- Regression models showed state-specific drivers: population growth negatively influenced NSW prices, while dwelling approvals were key in SA.
